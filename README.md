## Documentation

### Buying GPS
To be able to use the GPS you first need to buy the technology for your vehicle. Either buy a new vehicle and add the GPS or drive your current vehicle to the shop and add it.

### Open the menu
In order to open the menu hit `ctrl + S`.

### Setting up the line

#### AB line
The AB modus needs two points between which GPS will aligned.
1. Drive to the location you want to setup your lines.
2. Hit `alt + E` once (or use the menu) in order to reset the AB creation.
3. Hit `alt + E` once more (or use the menu) in order to set point A.
4. Hit `alt + E` once more (or use the menu) in order to set point B which will create the track.

### Auto width
Hit `alt + R` (or use the menu) in order to calculate the width of your vehicle.
Unfold and lower the vehicle in order to get the best results.

### Increase/descrease width
Hit `alt + plus` and `alt + minus` in order to change the width

_Please note that this only works after the track creation!_

### Terrain angle snapping
If you're not able to create straight lines yourself you can enable angle snapping in the menu. This will align the AB lines with the terrain.

### Toggle guidance steering
Once a track is created hit `alt + X` to toggle the steering.

### Headland control
Currently it auto stops at the headland when cruise control is enabled. Headland turning is still being worked on.

### Store and load tracks
It's also possible to store the tracks and reload them. Open the second page in the menu in order to do so.
